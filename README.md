Small library for experimenting with etcd's **Raft** using **gRPC** as a communication layer.

## Usage

See the `example` folder and [example/proton/init.go](https://github.com/abronan/proton/blob/master/example/proton/init.go) as well as [example/proton/join.go](https://github.com/abronan/proton/blob/master/example/proton/join.go) for examples of usage.

## TODO

- Provide a better abstraction
- Implement Store interface with a boltdb backend
